Cancer evolution
------
I am computer scientist and bioinformatician by training, focusing on cancer evolution. I am developping my research as a PI at the Cancer Research Centre of Lyon, as part of the [Integrated Analysis of Cancer Dynamics team](http://www.crcl.fr/761-Emerging-Team-Integrated-analysis-of-the-dynamics-of-cancer.crcl.aspx?language=en-GB) led by Pierre Saintigny (PhD, MD). The research we develop aim to provide means to <b>quantify, predict and control cancer evolution</b>.

Collaborative environment
------
Cancer evolution is at the crossroads of multiple scientific domains and our projects are highly collaborative, with complementary expertises both within the team and through external collaborations. In addition to bioinformatics, the research we lead includes experimental biology, clinical oncology and mathematical modeling. Synergy is key!
